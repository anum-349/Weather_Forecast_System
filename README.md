## 🌍 Overview

**Weather_Forecast_System** is a comprehensive **C++ toolkit** designed for accurate weather and air quality forecasting, efficient data management, and offline operations.

It uses modular components to streamline **geographic data handling** and integrates **external APIs** for real-time insights, making it suitable for both educational and production-level weather applications.

---

## ✨ Features

* 🗺️ **Location Management:** Add, remove, and organize geographic points for precise data targeting.
* 🌦️ **Weather Data Retrieval:** Fetch both real-time and historical weather data from external APIs.
* 💾 **Offline Mode & Data Export:** Export data as CSV/JSON and continue using the app without an internet connection.
* 🌍 **Air Quality Monitoring:** Integrate and analyze environmental and pollution data.
* 🔧 **Modular Architecture:** Clean and maintainable code structure, optimized for cross-platform support.
